## Description
An ecommerce site for a company called Abstract. Abstract specializes in the societal and environmental effects and byproducts of consumerism and materialism. **This website is completely and unequivocally satire.**

## Purpose
The main purpose of Abstract is NOT to make fun of consumerism/materialism, but was meant to build knowledge and familiarity with MongoDB and building a full stack application with a non-relational DB.
