## Description
Abstract is an innovative ecommerce store that offers a unique focus on concepts related to consumerism and materialism. Instead of traditional physical products, Abstract specializes in selling these thought-provoking concepts themselves. By challenging conventional notions of commerce, Abstract provides customers with an intellectual and philosophical exploration of consumerism and materialism.

> **This website is completely and unequivocally satire.**

Abstract Store is the product of digital design agency Abstract Creative (also not real). View Abstract Creative [here](https://abstract-creative.vercel.app/).

## Purpose
The main purpose of Abstract is NOT to make fun of consumerism/materialism, but was meant to build knowledge and familiarity with MongoDB and building a full stack application with a non-relational DB.
